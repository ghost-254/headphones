 * Assignment: Implementing a design from scratch (HTML and CSS)

**/

In this project, we will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. 
We will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that we have learned previously.

We will not have a lot of instructions, we are free to implement it the way that we want.
The objective is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer file.
